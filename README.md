# 🥣 OneBowl – Every Animal Deserves OneBowl 🐾

OneBowl is an **open-source platform** designed to make feeding stray animals simple, transparent, and impactful.  
Donors can select animals (dogs, cats, cows, monkeys, etc.), choose food items, donate securely, and **track their impact** with real proof (photos/videos of animals being fed).
